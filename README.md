# Description.
The main function of the program: it allows the user to create a database file as .csv with hardcoded header, ['First-name', 'Last-name', 'Gender', 'Address', 'City', 'Phone', 'Email']. by entering the info into the respected entry box you can add to a or create a .csv file. you can give personal file names to your .csv file and come back to it and append new client info. For the moment you can not modify nor change the headers. the .csv file are saved in my documents as {filename}.csv

# How to use.
Enter the info of the client, last-name must contain info, phone number numbers only and email must be in correct format or it will refuse to add to .csv, you must give a name to your file. At the left side, you will see a last entry box showing the entry already existing or last added to the .csv file.
